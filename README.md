## Project2: Data Cleaning by postgreSQL.
Although some of the Python packages(pandas, numpy) is very powerful for data cleaning, SQL is also very useful and convinient for data cleaning. In this project, I will use postgreSQL to do the data organization, management and cleaning.   
[The codes and explainations are recorded here](https://github.com/sarahzhao21/data_organization_cleaning_by_SQL.git).  
The processes of data cleaning that have been used in this project include:  
1.Add new columns to a table and update those columns.   
2.Delete useless columns from a table.   
3.Extract different elements from timestamp or date records.     
4.Extract different elements from strings and rebuilt strings.   
5.Check if there are null values in a columns and repopulate the null values based on other columns or rows.   
6.Check if there are duplicate rows in the table and remove the duplicate rows.   
7.Change some kind of values to different values in a column.      

## Project3: A Network Based Music Recommendation System.
In this era of the Internet, popular music has also been greatly developed, with more and more ordinary musicians publishing their works on the Internet platform, and new popular musics born almost every day; besides, the taste of the audience is no longer limited to their favorite singers. Based on this background, we want to set up a music recommendation system based on the song network to help the audience to find more music that suits their taste.

## Project4: Trout Lake Temperature Prediction by Machine Learning Algorithm.
Lake monitoring provides important information for environment protection and pollution identification, such as temperature/thermal monitoring. In this Kaggle task, the instructor will provide thermal sensor data for multiple lakes and ask people to predict/estimate the temperature at a certain depth for certain lakes. The Lake Trout’s data during the period of Apr 20th, 2012 - Apr 19th, 2018 was provided. There will be multiple sensors at different depths, and what will be provided include: lake_id, time, depth and the corresponding temperature at this depth and time point.

## Project5: Sentiment Analysis and Prediction by User Reviews with NLP Deep Learning Models.
For this project, we would like to explore the relationship between yelp user reviews and yelp user ratings of restaurants. User rating is a good indicator of user attitudes towards local business. Inspired by the novel approaches that integrate NLP with deep learning, this project aims to train an algorithm that predicts the classes of user ratings with user reviews. This algorithm could be used to detect the user attitudes to restaurants from other crowdsourcing narratives (e.g. Tweets about restaurants) and can potentially expand the rating system of local restaurants.

## Project6: Discover Patients’ Health Care Demand -- Drug Review Analysis by Natural Language Processing.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019, disease prevention and health improvement play more and more important roles in people’s life. With the rapid development of the pharmaceutical industry, large numbers of new medications have been developed and launched to market. Although the medication products were approved by FDA, it doesn’t mean the products are effective for each patient. Thus, it becomes very critical to understand the performance and related features of the drugs on users. Recent years, text and natural language analysis captures more attention as it can explore deeper information and bring more insight into the quantitative methodology, so it can be used to analyze users’ demand.

This kind of study will be helpful for the pharmaceutical industry to better understand consumers’ demand and health needs, as well as patients’ responses for corresponding medications. The marketing managers or business leads will also care about these studies because understanding consumers’ needs, or intentions will be helpful for the marketing forecast.

## Project7:Gene Expression and Epigenetics Analysis of Pediatric High Grade Gliomas (Bioinformatics Analysis by R)
### Introduction
Pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGGs) are a leading cause of pediatric cancer death. Unlike the adult HGGs, there are no effective therapeutic intervention or treatment exists for this sort of cancers. Although the adult and pediatric HGGs are histologically similar, they are clinically, biologically, and molecularly distinct. And Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), the untreatable, heterogeneous pHGG of the brainstem, is a highly aggressive cancer affects mostly young children and is uniformly fatal, which needs specific treatment approaches. An important discovery on the molecular principles of pHGGs reveals that more than a third of patients harbor somatic mutations in H3F3A, the gene encoding the histone variant H3.3. So, identification of the epigenetic features and gene expressional profiles of different subgroups of pHGGs by the mutation types of Histone H3 will provide important information on targeted therapy.    
For __more details and R code about this study__, please look at the [report](https://github.com/sarahzhao21/Gene-Expression-and-Epigenetics-Analysis-of-Pediatric-Gliomas-Bioinformatics-Analysis-by-R/blob/948500d9f2d533af4e2eb69d02afe61ed4ec2a82/Gene_Expression_Epigenetics_Analysis_pHGGs%20(Sarah%20Zhao%208.14.2020).pdf) and the contents in this [repository](https://github.com/sarahzhao21/Gene-Expression-and-Epigenetics-Analysis-of-Pediatric-Gliomas-Bioinformatics-Analysis-by-R.git).   
### Data Resource
Main datasets: GSE26576, GSE50021, GSE19578, GSE34824, GSE36245, GSE50022, GSE36278, GSE55712 E-TABM-857, E-TABM-1107. The main datasets were downloaded from National Center for Biotechnology Information [Gene Expression Omnibus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)
### Summary of Results
#### Methylation-based Alterations in H3.3K27M mutant of DIPG
The main datasets come from GSE36278 and GSE55712, and only the types of H3.3K27M and WT are kept in this study. The methylation status difference analysis has been done by “champ” method on the two groups, and these two datasets reveal quite consistent results. The scale heatmaps show that the probes can be separated into two clusters for each group, methylation increased, and methylation decreased clusters. The H3.3K27M and WT groups have quite different methylation levels for each cluster. And generally, the entire methylation levels in H3.3K27M groups are higher than the WT group.  
![Methylation heat map](https://github.com/sarahzhao21/Gene-Expression-and-Epigenetics-Analysis-of-Pediatric-Gliomas-Bioinformatics-Analysis-by-R/blob/a6050a2da32a07177ed4c5b780114b0776256a9f/Methylation%20Analysis%20images/step4_test_heatmap_top200_DEG_scale%202.png). 
#### Gene expressional alterations in pHGGs (mRNA Microarray)
GO analysis explored the upregulated and downregulated genes in H3.3K27M mutant samples. There are multiple upregulated signaling pathways involved in neuron development and synapse transmission, including synapse organization, axonogenesis, regulation of neuron projection development, modulation of chemical synaptic transmission, regulation of trans-synaptic signaling, synapse assembly, etc.  
The down-regulated signaling pathways mainly include neutrophil related factors, such as neutrophil activation involved in immune response, neutrophil degranulation and neutrophil mediated immunity, as well as mitochondria related signal such as mitochondrial protein complex, mitochondrial matrix and mitochondrial gene expression. 

## Project8: The-Impact-of-COVID-19-Pandemic-on-Students-Career-Outcomes

### Introduction 
Students’ experiences in college can have a significant impact on their success during college and later in life. For example, results from the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE, 2018) consistently show that there is a positive relationship between participation in co-curricular activities and academic performance. This study examines the relationships between participation in a variety of types of co-curricular activities and a number of social, academic, and professional outcomes, in order to see which dimensions are most predictive. [The R Codes and details can be found in the repository.](https://github.com/sarahzhao21/The-Impact-of-COVID-19-Pandemic-on-Students-Career-Outcomes.git)

### Conceptual Framework 
Our conceptual framework largely based on Astin’s Input-Environment-Output theory and Weidman’s conceptual framework of Undergraduate Socialization. Astin, Weidman, and others hypothesized that student Background Characteristics (e.g., demographics) effect Socialization Outcomes (e.g., post-college aspirations), and that they are mediated by Collegiate Experiences. Weidman’s conceptual framework identifies two categories of Collegiate Experiences: Socialization Processes and Normative Contexts. 
![conceptual Framework](https://github.com/sarahzhao21/The-Impact-of-COVID-19-Pandemic-on-Students-Career-Outcomes/blob/946ec0aeed686ac1ec23019c07d1f15b5c9755b9/socialization%20outcomes%20model.png)
### Research Questions:
In this study, we chose to study aspects of social, academic, and professional outcomes, specifically as they pertain to outcomes that we believe may be influenced by students’ demographics, proactive behaviors and participation in co-curricular activities, which include: 1) social capital, or the productive benefits derived from an individual’s social network 2) engineering identity and the intention to persist in engineering. The most important aspect in our study is to see if the dimensions that impact the outcomes are consistent before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Survey Sample:
In 2018, we invited 4,022 third- and fourth-year undergraduate engineering students at a large public Midwestern R1 university to complete the survey and received 870 completed responses. In 2021, during COVID-19 pandemic, we invited 2214 third- and fourth-year undergraduate engineering students from the same college to complete the survey and received 532 completed responses.
All items measuring students’ experiences with proactive behaviors were measured using a seven-point Likert scale (where 1 = Strongly Disagree and 7 = Strongly Agree). 

### Statistical models:
1.	To estimate the construct validity of the seven-point Likert scale for each dimension, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) of this scale have been done. 
2.	To confirm that the pre-COVID students and during-COVID students who completed our survey in 2018 and 2021 respectively are comparable, a series of t-test have been done to compare the Background Characteristics of these two groups. To avoid Type I error, I also used MAVOVA to confirm the significance of t-test.
3.	To understand What combination of student background characteristics, proactive behaviors, participation in engineering co-curricular activities, best predict outcomes before the COVID-19 pandemic, and how do the predictors change when predicting outcomes during the pandemic, I implemented series of linear regression models and evaluated the performance of the model by AIC values and adjusted R-square. The R package “leaps” has been used to build the models with all the combinations of the candidate predictors. 
4.	To further validate the performance of the best models, the dataset has been randomly split into train and test sets (50% for each), the train set has been used to fit the best models and the full models and the test set has been used to test the accuracy of the models. The performance of the models was evaluated by MAE, MSE, RMSE and R-square. The results showed that the best models always perform better than the full models.     

### Conclusion:  
These findings have interesting implications, as they provide additional paths for student success. We propose that pedagogical and programmatic designs which enhance positive framing, and possibly the related concepts of self-efficacy and growth mindset, may lead to better outcomes.
