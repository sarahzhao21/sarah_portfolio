## Project1: Information retrieval by SQL and data visualization by Tableau
Since the pandemic of COVID-19 in early 2019, people's lives were dramatically changed. The aim of this study is to figure out the most recent situations of death rate, infected rate and vaccination rate of all the countries in the world by SQL and to create easy to read visualizations on that by Tableau.

## Project2: A Network Based Music Recommendation System
In this era of the Internet, popular music has also been greatly developed, with more and more ordinary musicians publishing their works on the Internet platform, and new popular musics born almost every day; besides, the taste of the audience is no longer limited to their favorite singers. Based on this background, we want to set up a music recommendation system based on the song network to help the audience to find more music that suits their taste.

## Project3: Trout Lake Temperature Prediction by Machine Learning Algorithm
Lake monitoring provides important information for environment protection and pollution identification, such as temperature/thermal monitoring. In this Kaggle task, the instructor will provide thermal sensor data for multiple lakes and ask people to predict/estimate the temperature at a certain depth for certain lakes. The Lake Troutâ€™s data during the period of Apr 20th, 2012 - Apr 19th, 2018 was provided. There will be multiple sensors at different depths, and what will be provided include: lake_id, time, depth and the corresponding temperature at this depth and time point.

### Task
Predicting/estimating the temperature of Trout Lake at depth 10.5 m during Apr 20th, 2018 - Apr 19th, 2019. 
Benchmark 1:  MSE < 0.065
Benchmark 2:  MSE < 0.032.

## Project4: Sentiment Analysis and Prediction by User Reviews with NLP Deep Learning Models.
For this project, we would like to explore the relationship between yelp user reviews and yelp user ratings of restaurants. User rating is a good indicator of user attitudes towards local business. Inspired by the novel approaches that integrate NLP with deep learning, this project aims to train an algorithm that predicts the classes of user ratings with user reviews. This algorithm could be used to detect the user attitudes to restaurants from other crowdsourcing narratives (e.g. Tweets about restaurants) and can potentially expand the rating system of local restaurants.
